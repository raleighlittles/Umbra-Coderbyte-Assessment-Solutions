# About

This repository contains the interview questions as part of the [Umbra Labs](https://umbra.space/) interview process.

There's 3 types of questions:

* 2 programming questions (see q1 and q2 folders). Answers must be given in C or C++, I chose C++.

* Behavioral questions (see [behavioral.md](./behavioral.md))

* Multiple-choice questions about Python (see [multiple_choice.md](./multiple_choice.md))
